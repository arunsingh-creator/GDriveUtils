### Getting started
> This guide will cover everything for deploying the bot properly. Focus and patience are needed are as always.
- Run the below script to clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/missemily2022/GDriveUtils
cd GDriveUtils
```

### Configuring the bot
 There are three mandatory files that are needed for the bot to run
1. [credentials.json]
2. [drive_list]
3. [config.env]

### Getting the credentials.json file
- Visit the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
- Go to the *OAuth consent screen* tab, fill the form and save it
- Then go to the *Credentials* tab and click on *Create Credentials* -> *OAuth client ID*
- Choose *Desktop* from the list and click on the *Create* button
- Now click on the *Download JSON* button to download the credential file
- Move that file to the root of the repo and rename it to **credentials.json**
- Then run the below script
```
pip3 install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```

### Getting the drive_list file
- Run the below script and follow the screen to get the **drive_list** file
```
python3 dlist.py
```

### Getting the Service Account files
**Warning:** Abuse of this feature is not the aim and not recommended to make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 SAs will allow a plenty of use. It's also possible that over abuse might get the projects banned by Google.
> **NOTE:** If you have created SAs in the past from this script, you can also just re-download the keys by running the below script
```
python3 gen_sa.py --download-keys PROJECTID
```
<br>

> There are two methods available for creating Service Accounts
- [Creating SAs in existing project (Recommended)]
- [Creating SAs in new project]
##### Creating SAs in existing project (Recommended)
- List projects ids
```
python3 gen_sa.py --list-projects
```
- Enable services
```
python3 gen_sa.py --enable-services PROJECTID
```
- Create Sevice Accounts
```
python3 gen_sa.py --create-sas PROJECTID
```
- Download Sevice Accounts
```
python3 gen_sa.py --download-keys PROJECTID
```
> **Note:** Remember to replace `PROJECTID` with your project id.

##### Creating SAs in new project
- Run the below script to generate Service Accounts and download automatically
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only
```

### Getting the GDToT cookies
- Login / Register to [GDToT](https://new.gdtot.eu)
- Copy the below script and paste it on the address bar
```
javascript:(function () {
  const input = document.createElement('input');
  input.value = JSON.stringify({url : window.location.href, cookie : document.cookie});
  document.body.appendChild(input);
  input.focus();
  input.select();
  var result = document.execCommand('copy');
  document.body.removeChild(input);
  if(result)
    alert('Copied cookies to clipboard');
  else
    prompt('Copy the below cookies\n', input.value);
})();
```
- Hit enter and the browser will prompt an alert
- Now check the clipboard, there will be a data like this, that's the GDToT cookies
```
{"url":"https://new.gdtot.eu/","cookie":"crypt=NGxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxWdSVT0%3D; PHPSESSID=k2xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxj63o"}
```
- Then focus on the cookies, there will be the value of `PHPSESSID` and `CRYPT`

### Setting up the config.env file
> Rename config_sample.env to config.env

***Required config***
- `BOT_TOKEN`: Get this token by creating a bot in [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- `OWNER_ID`: Fill the user ID of bot owner
- `DRIVE_TOKEN`: Run the below script to generate this token
```
python3 dtoken.py
```
- `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`: Fill the folder ID of drive where the data will be cloned to

***Optional config***
- `AUTHORIZED_CHATS`: Fill the user_id and/or chat_id you want to authorize, separate them with space.<br>**Example:** *1234567890* *-1122334455* *921229569*
- `DATABASE_URL`: Create a cluster on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) to get this value
- `IS_TEAM_DRIVE`: Set to **True** if the *DRIVE_FOLDER_ID* is from a Shared Drive
- `USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS`: Set to **True** if the data will be cloned using Service Accounts. Refer to [Getting the Service Account files] for this to work.
- `PHPSESSID`: Refer to [Getting the GDToT cookies] to get this value
- `CRYPT`: Refer to [Getting the GDToT cookies] to get this value
- `DRIVE_INDEX_URL`: Refer to maple's [GDIndex](https://github.com/maple3142/GDIndex/) or Bhadoo's [Google Drive Index](https://gitlab.com/ParveenBhadooOfficial/Google-Drive-Index)<br>**Note:** The Index URL should not have any trailing '**/**'
- `ACCOUNTS_ZIP_URL`: Archive the **accounts** folder to a zip file. Then fill the direct download link of that file.
- `DRIVE_LIST_URL`: Upload the **drive_list** file on [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com). Now open the raw link of that gist and remove Commit ID from the link. Then fill the var with that link.<br>**Note:** This var is required for Deploying with [Workflow] to Heroku.
- `MAX_THREADS` : Number to threads to use while searching gdrive. Recomended value is 4*core count (4 for heroku). But result time may vary dependending upon machine, so test with different values and see which gives results in least time.
Note: Setting it too high or too low may take more time to display results than expected.

```
/search -f <query>
```
- `-d` is for searching folders only
```
/search -d <query>
```

This is a telegram bot writen in python for searching data on Google Drive. Supports multiple Shared Drives (TDs). Able to clone data from drive.

### Can I deploy this bot on [Railway](https://railway.app)?
No, they will flag your account.

### Why there's no "Deploy to Heroku" button?
Deploy with [Workflow] or [CLI]. But if you need that button, follow the below steps
- Fork the [repo](https://github.com/missemily2022/GDriveUtils)
- Upload this [app.json](https://gist.github.com/missemily2022/76c65d741ba96ed7f700d764edff7c8d) file on the root directory of your forked repo
- Then add the below code in Readme.md
```
[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/<username>/GDriveUtils)
```
> **Note**: Remember to replace `<username>` with your GitHub username

### Does this bot support recursive search?
Yes, that means it can search on sub-directories too.

### Will this bot work with Folder ID?
No

### Does this bot support cloning files?
Yes, that means it can clone data from drive or gdtot links.

### How to remove commit id from a gist raw link?
For example here's a gist raw link from which we will remove the commit id
```
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/missemily2022/7o1eed3691f87f7dcah11af1ld4bdeb1/raw/92b7a460031d5v171a546ccad274f3e7f44fka46/config.env
```
Now focus on the link, there's an alphanumeric code exists after **raw** and before **config.env**. That's the commit id. Now remove that code along with a slash (**/**). So the final link will be like this
```
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/missemily2022/7o1eed3691f87f7dcah11af1ld4bdeb1/raw/config.env
```

### How to add SAs into Shared Drive
- Mount the accounts folder
```
cd accounts
```
> Grab emails form all SAs into emails.txt file

- For Windows using PowerShell
```
$emails = Get-ChildItem .\**.json |Get-Content -Raw |ConvertFrom-Json |Select -ExpandProperty client_email >>emails.txt
```
- For Linux / MacOs
```
grep -oPh '"client_email": "\K[^"]+' *.json > emails.txt
```
- Unmount the acounts folder
```
cd ..
```
- Now add emails from emails.txt to a Google Group, then add that Google Group to your Shared Drive and promote to `Manager`. After that delete email.txt file from the accounts folder.

### Getting this error - 'python3' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
Use `py` instead of `python3`

### How to fix when the bot gets stuck while searching?
Check the log file first. If it doesn't help then go [here](https://github.com/missemily2022/GDriveUtils/tree/master/bot/helper/drive_utils/gdriveTools.py#L30) and change the `telegraph_limit` value to a lower value. Default is 120.
